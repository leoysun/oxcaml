# TicTacToe using OCaml

To make a dev-environment, press the green "Code" button, then select "+" next to "Codespaces".  A new Codespace will open.  It currently takes 20-40 minutes to initialize; please be patient.

Once initialized you need to run the following commands:
```shell
opam init -a --disable-sandboxing --yes --bare && \
        opam update -a && \
        opam switch create 4.14.0 --yes  && \
        eval $(opam env --switch 4.14.0) && \
        opam install --yes  ocamlformat merlin ocaml-lsp-server bonsai
```

Afterwards you should have a full OPAM environment with the OCaml compiler and dune on the path.  VSCode will have the OCaml Platform plugin together with the LSP server and merlin, the editor assistant.

## Building the OCaml project
Make sure you're using the right opam switch:
```shell
eval $(opam env --switch 4.14.0)
```

To format the files:
```shell
dune fmt
```

To build and run tests continously:
```shell
dune build @runtest --watch
```

To promote/update expect-tests:
```shell
dune promote
```

To update the javascript:
```shell
cp _build/default/ui/tictactoe_ui.bc.js generated_js/
```
Then you can either test it locally in VSCode by starting a local http server:
```shell
python3 -m http.server 8000
```
